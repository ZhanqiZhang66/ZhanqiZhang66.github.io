### Past

Hi! My name is Victoria Zhanqi Zhang, 张展旗.

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSD, supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by [Dr. Mikio Aoi](https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/) and [Dr. Gal Mishne](http://mishne.ucsd.edu/). Previously, I studied Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I was advised by [Dr. Carlos Ponce](https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/) as an undergrad research student. I was the Co-president of [Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society](https://www.tbp.org/off/DisplayChapterInfo.cfm?ID=99), Missouri Gamma Chapter.

I am broadly interested in how machine and biological intelligence complement each other to push forward the discoveries of the brain. My research interests include machine learning, computational system neuroscience, optimization and signal processing. Specifically, I am currently interested in how human behavior reflects complex neural and physiological processes such as learning, perception, and decision-making in the brain. Using tools in machine learning, computational neuroscience, optimization, and signal processing, I attempt to construct unsupervised animal and human action recognition and behavior classification models to understand disorders in clinical settings.

I grew up in a small town in China. When I was 12, my family moved to Beijing. In 2016, I came to the US for college.

Fresh off the boat, I struggled to find my voice in the engineering classroom and to confidently articulate my thoughts in front of male classmates. I learned to seek guidance and, when I was at my lowest point, my advisors, [Dr. Emily Boyd](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Emily-Boyd.html) in Mechanical Engineering, and [Dr. Caitlin Kelleher](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Caitlin-Kelleher.html) in Computer Science, both exemplars of successful women in STEM, provided solace. They taught me that it is okay to feel lost, but I needed to move forward step by step.


My early years taught me to never give up and motivated me to discover, conquer and achieve. I fell in love with Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Neuroscience at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). Actively participating in seminar series and journal clubs, I am fascinated by how machine and biological intelligence complement each other to push forward the discoveries in science.

I joined [Dr. Carlos Ponce](https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/)’s laboratory at WashU to study visual information encoding in the primate brain. This valuable experience have instilled in me a passion for the deeper insights of scientific research and motivated me to pursue a doctoral program.

### Present

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by [Dr. Mikio Aoi](https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/) and [Dr. Gal Mishne](http://mishne.ucsd.edu/). Using tools in computer science,  neuroscience, and signal processing, I attempt to construct behavior models to understand disorders in psychiatry. I’m listing my projects [here](https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/publications/) and documenting my learning notes in this [blog](https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/blog/).   

Aside from school, my personal experiences have taught me to appreciate social support and
promote diversity in my community. Through college, I served as TA and tutor to make ends
meet and met many people from underrepresented backgrounds. Some were female students
experiencing stress in male-dominated courses; some came from minority ethnic groups with
family pressure. As a girl raised in a family that longed for a boy, I related
to their stories.

Through teaching and service, I hope to keep empowering diversity in the community. In graduate school, I am a mentor at [Simons Foundation Global Brain Program](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/collaborations/global-brain/people/?category=global-brain-surf-mentors&type=global-brain-fellows). I connected undergraduate mentee from underrepresented backgrounds to research opportunities, provide strategies for handling difficult work situations, and offer positive feedbacks. I am also a member of [UCSE CSE DEI community](https://cse.ucsd.edu/diversity/cse-dei-committee). At home, when Chinese gender norms stripped girls of opportunities, I encouraged my younger sister to run for leadership roles and to join the formerly male-only
football team. On social media, I lead women in China today on issues like #MeToo.

In my free time, I enjoy painting, hiking, travelling, and surfing. I live with two happy free-flying birds: cockatiel Ashe and parakeet Kiwi. I love DIY swings and castles for them and teaching them new songs and cool tricks. Here is the [Art Portfolio](https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/art/) of some of my watercolor and color pencil drawings.

### Future

I had been truly lost, but through a supportive community and determination, I connected my
dots and found my way. I can see myself as a
competent and enthusiastic scientist, and an empathetic and resilient human being. I will
continue to engage in research and contribute to society and I hope my research and support
will one day become a dot in someone else’s path.
