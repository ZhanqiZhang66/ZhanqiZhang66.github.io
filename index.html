<h3>About me</h3>

<p>
  Hi! My name is Victoria Zhanqi Zhang, 张展旗. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSD, supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by <a href="https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Mikio Aoi</a> and <a href="http://mishne.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Gal Mishne</a>. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I was advised by <a href="https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Carlos Ponce</a> as an undergrad research student. 
</p>
<!-- <p>If you want to learn more about me and my life, here is <a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/aboutme/">my story</a>. </p> -->
<p>
  I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href='https://ucsd.edu/'>UCSD<a/>, supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by <a href="https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Mikio Aoi</a> and <a href="http://mishne.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Gal Mishne</a>. Using tools in computer science,  neuroscience, and signal processing, I attempt to construct behavior models to understand disorders in pychiatry. I’m listing my projects<a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/blog/"> here</a> and documenting my learning notes in this <a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/blog/">blog</a>.   
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I enjoy painting, hiking, travelling, and mentoring. I live with two happy free-flying birds: cockatiel Ashe and parakeet Kiwi. I love DIY swings and castles for them and teaching them new songs and cool tricks. Here is the <a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/art/">Art Portfolio</a> of some of my watercolor and color pencil drawings.

    <p>This interdisciplinary research project aims to build an framework to answer questions in computational psychiatry. It uses probabilistic reasoning to quantify hallmark features related to bipolar disorder. By combining our methods with neural activity dynamics, we could further associate behaviors to neural recordings to gain more insights on how information processing maps onto behaviors, putting us one step closer to understanding the link between the brain and the mind.

    <!-- <p>This interdisciplinary research project aims to build an unsupervised framework to address a need for quantification of undirected human behavior in open-field clinical assessment and analysis. It will combine computer vision, deep learning, and probabilistic reasoning to extract spatiotemporal dynamics of human subjects from video. Furthermore, we will differentiate behavioral motifs and quantify hallmark features related to bipolar disorder. The principles of our approach are not specific to certain tasks or animal models. In the future, we plan to extend our framework to study and compare behavioral structure in other neuropsychiatric disorders, within or across species. Furthermore, by combining our methods with neural activity dynamics, we could further associate behaviors to neural recordings to gain more insights on how information processing maps onto behaviors, putting us one step closer to understanding the link between the brain and the mind.

      <p><a href="https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/">Ponce Lab</a> advised by Dr. Carlos Ponce in Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School</p><p>Automated visual recognition has the potential to change many facets of society, from biomedical imaging to security and transportation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the best models for visual recognition, and while they show enormous promise, they are notably vulnerable to "black-box attacks" -- malicious inputs designed to make the networks make mistakes. Because CNNs share many properties with the brain, we can understand what kind of attacks are particularly effective on the most resilient CNNs, by crafting attacks that manipulate activity in the brain. The Ponce lab has shown that it is possible to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to maximize the activity of individual neurons in the brain, through the synthesis of artificial images. I will explore which types of GANs are best in achieving this goal, in both macaque brains and convolutional neural networks.

    <p>I investigated sonification techinique that can be used to visualize high-dimensional data like images. The goal is to understand the benefits of sonification compound to visual representations especially in the context of human-in-the-loop systems</p>
