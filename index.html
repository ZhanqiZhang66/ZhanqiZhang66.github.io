<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Victoria Zhanqi Zhang, 张展旗. 
</p>
<!-- <p>
  Hi! My name is Victoria Zhanqi Zhang, 张展旗. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSD, supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by <a href="https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Mikio Aoi</a> and <a href="http://mishne.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Gal Mishne</a>. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I was advised by <a href="https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Carlos Ponce</a> as an undergrad research student. I was the Co-president of <a href="https://www.tbp.org/off/DisplayChapterInfo.cfm?ID=99">Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society</a>, Missouri Gamma Chapter. 
</p> -->
<!-- <p>
  I am broadly interested in how machine and biological intelligence complement each other to push forward the discoveries of the brain. My research interests include machine learning, computational system neuroscience, optimization and signal processing. Specifically, I am currently interested in how human behavior reflects complex neural and physiological processes such as learning, perception, and decision-making in the brain. Using tools in machine learning, computational neuroscience, optimization, and signal processing, I attempt to construct unsupervised animal and human action recognition and behavior classification models to understand disorders in clinical settings. 
</p> -->
<p>I grew up in a small village in China. When I was 12, my family moved to Beijing. Unfortunately, my Huji, the national registration system, classified me as ineligible for high education in the cities. Despite this, I worked hard to free myself. In 2016, I came to the US for college.
</p>
<p>
  Fresh off the boat, I struggled to find my voice in the engineering classroom and to confidently articulate my thoughts in front of male classmates. I learned to seek guidance and, when I was at my lowest point, my advisors, Dr. Emily Boyd in Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Caitlin Kelleher in Computer Science, both exemplars of successful women in STEM, provided solace. They taught me that it is okay to feel lost, but I needed to move forward step by step. 
</p>
<p>
  My early years taught me to never give up and motivated me to discover, conquer and achieve. I fell in love with Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis. Actively participating in seminar series and journal clubs, I am fascinated by how machine and biological intelligence complement each other to push forward the discoveries in science. 
</p>
<p>
 I joined <a href="https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Carlos Ponce</a>’s laboratory at WashU to study visual information encoding in the primate brain. This valuable experience have instilled in me a passion for the deeper insights of scientific research and motivated me to pursue a doctoral program.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSD, supported by HDSI Phd Fellowship. I am honored to be co-advised by <a href="https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Mikio Aoi</a> and <a href="http://mishne.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Gal Mishne</a>. Using tools in computer science,  neuroscience, and signal processing, I attempt to construct behavior models to understand disorders in pychiatry. I’m listing my projects<a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/blog/"> here</a> and documenting my learning notes in this <a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/blog/">blog</a>.   
</p>

<p>
  Aside from school, my personal experiences have taught me to appreciate social support and
promote diversity in my community. Through college, I served as TA and tutor to make ends
meet and met many people from underrepresented backgrounds. Some were female students
experiencing stress in male-dominated courses; some came from minority ethnic groups with
family pressure. As a girl raised in a family that longed for a boy, I related
to their stories.
</p> 
<p>
Through teaching and service, I hope to keep empowering diversity in the community. In graduate school, I am a mentor at <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/collaborations/global-brain/people/?category=global-brain-surf-mentors&type=global-brain-fellows">Simons Foundation Global Brain Program</a>. I connected undergraduate mentee from underrepresented backgrounds to research opportunities, provide strategies for handling difficult work situations, and offer positive feedbacks. At home, when Chinese gender norms stripped girls of opportunities, I encouraged my younger sister to run for leadership roles and to join the formerly male-only
football team. On social media, I lead women in China today on issues like #MeToo. 
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I enjoy painting, hiking, travelling, and surfing. I live with two happy free-flying birds: cockatiel Ashe and parakeet Kiwi. I love DIY swings and castles for them and teaching them new songs and cool tricks. Here is the <a href="https://zhanqizhang66.github.io/art/">Art Portfolio</a> of some of my watercolor and color pencil drawings. 
</p>
<p>
  I had been truly lost, but through a supportive community and determination, I connected my
dots and found my way. I will
continue to engage in research and contribute to society and I hope my research and support
will one day become a dot in someone else’s path.

    <p><a href="http://mishne.ucsd.edu/">Mishne Lab</a> and <a href="https://aoilab.biosci.ucsd.edu/">Aoi Lab</a> co-advised by Dr. Gal Mishne and Dr. Mikio Aoi in Department of Data Science, Computer Science, Neuroscience at University of California, San Diego</p>
    <p>This interdisciplinary research project aims to build an framework to answer questions in computational psychiatry. It uses probabilistic reasoning to quantify hallmark features related to bipolar disorder. By combining our methods with neural activity dynamics, we could further associate behaviors to neural recordings to gain more insights on how information processing maps onto behaviors, putting us one step closer to understanding the link between the brain and the mind.

    <!-- <p>This interdisciplinary research project aims to build an unsupervised framework to address a need for quantification of undirected human behavior in open-field clinical assessment and analysis. It will combine computer vision, deep learning, and probabilistic reasoning to extract spatiotemporal dynamics of human subjects from video. Furthermore, we will differentiate behavioral motifs and quantify hallmark features related to bipolar disorder. The principles of our approach are not specific to certain tasks or animal models. In the future, we plan to extend our framework to study and compare behavioral structure in other neuropsychiatric disorders, within or across species. Furthermore, by combining our methods with neural activity dynamics, we could further associate behaviors to neural recordings to gain more insights on how information processing maps onto behaviors, putting us one step closer to understanding the link between the brain and the mind.

      <p><a href="https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/">Ponce Lab</a> advised by Dr. Carlos Ponce in Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School</p><p>Automated visual recognition has the potential to change many facets of society, from biomedical imaging to security and transportation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the best models for visual recognition, and while they show enormous promise, they are notably vulnerable to "black-box attacks" -- malicious inputs designed to make the networks make mistakes. Because CNNs share many properties with the brain, we can understand what kind of attacks are particularly effective on the most resilient CNNs, by crafting attacks that manipulate activity in the brain. The Ponce lab has shown that it is possible to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to maximize the activity of individual neurons in the brain, through the synthesis of artificial images. I will explore which types of GANs are best in achieving this goal, in both macaque brains and convolutional neural networks.
